Logging in to the Admin Console
===============================

If you do not have a Stormpath account, you will need to sign-up for one. The sign-up page can be found here: https://api.stormpath.com/register

To log in to the Stormpath Admin Console you will need to enter 3 pieces of information:

- **Your Stormpath Tenant name:** This a unique name for your private Stormpath partition, represented by two words linked by a hyphen (e.g. "strong-cerberus"). You received this in your first "Welcome to Stormpath" email.
- **Your Email**
- **Your Password**

The only users that can log-in to your tenant's Admin Console are those who have Accounts inside the **Stormpath Administrators** Directory. For more information about adding tenant administrators, please see :ref:`admin-adding-admins`.

Session Timeout
---------------

Your authenticated session with the Stormpath Admin Console will terminate either:

- After 30 minutes of inactivity
- Upon detection your computer has gone into sleep mode or been shut down
- You close all tabs that the Admin Console is open in

Before you are logged out due to inactivity you will receive a warning.

.. _home-log-out:

Logging Out
-----------

To log out at any time, you can click on the drop-down menu in the top right, which has your Stormpath tenant's name on it. At the bottom of this menu you will see the "Logout" button.

As mention above, you will also be logged out when you close the tab(s) that the Admin Console is open in.
